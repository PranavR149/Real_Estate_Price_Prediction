# Project Description
This project analyzes and models real estate data to improve price prediction accuracy, offering valuable insights for real estate agencies and investors. It begins with comprehensive data cleaning, addressing missing values through median imputation and standardizing area measurements to square feet. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) uses visual tools to identify outliers, and a log transformation stabilizes variance. After feature scaling and one-hot encoding, the target variable is adjusted for future price projections at a 5% annual increase, based on the assumption of steady market growth.

Various predictive models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LSTM, are evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values. After hyperparameter tuning, Gradient Boosting proved to be the best model, achieving an MSE of 0.15, RMSE of 0.39, RÂ² of 0.92, and MAE of 0.12, making it the most accurate for predicting property prices over various timeframes.

Real-Time Usage: This project is relevant for real estate investment firms seeking data-driven property acquisition strategies. Accurate price predictions across different time horizons enable firms to identify undervalued assets and optimize investments. For instance, agencies can target properties in emerging neighborhoods, predicting both current values and future appreciation. This predictive capability enhances client advisory services and strengthens competitive advantage, while also facilitating risk management by assessing potential property value fluctuations over time.
