# Project Description
This project entails a sophisticated analysis and modeling of real estate data aimed at improving price prediction accuracy, providing critical insights for real estate agencies and investors. The initiative begins with meticulous data cleaning, addressing missing values through median imputation for numerical features and 'Unknown' designations for categorical ones. The project further standardizes area measurements to square feet while eliminating irrelevant columns to enhance dataset integrity. Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted using visual tools such as histograms and box plots to detect outliers in pivotal variables, including price and area. A log transformation is applied to mitigate the influence of extreme values, thereby stabilizing variance. Following data preparation, features are scaled using StandardScaler, and categorical variables are encoded with one-hot encoding. To enhance predictive capability, the target variable is adjusted by projecting future prices based on a 5% annual increase. Following this, a diverse range of predictive models is implemented, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The models are meticulously evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values, with hyperparameter tuning conducted via RandomizedSearchCV revealing Gradient Boosting as the most effective method for price predictions over one-year, two-year, and five-year timeframes.

Real-Time Usage: This project holds significant relevance for real estate investment firms seeking to make data-driven decisions regarding property acquisitions. By accurately predicting property values across various time horizons, firms can identify undervalued assets and optimize their investment strategies. For instance, a real estate agency could utilize these insights to target properties in emerging neighborhoods, predicting not only current market values but also projecting future appreciation based on historical trends. This predictive capability allows firms to provide tailored advice to clients, thereby enhancing their competitive edge and driving strategic decisions in a dynamic market environment. Moreover, such insights can facilitate risk management by enabling firms to assess potential fluctuations in property values over time, ultimately leading to more informed investment choices.
